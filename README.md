## 👨‍💻 what's good

 Honestly, i love making new projects. Prolly, you can see my github repos lots of noob project and some good projects there, whatever I built i just pushed ✌️. Having said that Im the SWE Intern @Mutual of Omaha | Prev Data Engineering Intern @Thrift Label (Blackstone). 

built some cool stuff that people actually use. ran a tutoring center as CTO that has 85+ students while  95% of students passing (because who doesn't love those numbers?).Thats my company website https://dstutoringcenter.company/( make sure you should read the reviews of my tutoring Center lol)

**currently obsessed with:** ML models , building APIs that actually make sense, and making the web accessible for everyone
