## 👨‍💻 what's good

CS student @ CCNY who actually enjoys debugging (yeah, i know, weird flex). currently vibing as a web accessibility intern @ baxter st. camera club and was just chilling as a data engineering intern @ thrift label.

built some cool stuff that people actually use. ran a tutoring center as CTO that pulled in $35K+ while keeping 95% of students passing (because who doesn't love those numbers?).

**currently obsessed with:** ML models that don't suck, building APIs that actually make sense, and making the web accessible for everyone
